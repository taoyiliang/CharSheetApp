The  target becomes  a  skeleton  if  you  chose  bones  or  a zombie  if  you  chose  a  corpse  (the  DM  has  the creatures  game  statistics).  The  creature  is  under  your  control  for  24 hours,  after  which  it  stops  obeying  any  command you  have  given  it.

This  area  is  divorced  from  the weave  of  magical  energy  that  suffuses  the multiverse.  Within  the  cloud,  spells  fizzle  out, summoned  creatures  disappear,  and  even  magic items  become  mundane.  Until  the  spell  ends,  the cloud  moves  with  you,  centered  on  you.  Magical  effects,  except  those  created  by  an artifact  or  a  deity,  are  suppressed  in  the  cloud and  cannot  protrude  into  it.  While  an  effect  is suppressed,  it  does  not  function,  but  the  time  it spends  suppressed  counts  against  its  duration.  Targeted  Effects:  Spells  and  other  magical effects,  such  as  magic  missile  and  charm  person, that  target  a  creature  or  an  object  in  the  cloud have  no  effect  on  that  target.  Areas  of  Magic:  The  area  of  another  spell  or magical  effect,  such  as  fireball,  cannot  extend into  the  cloud,  and  if  the  cloud  overlaps  an  area of  magic,  the  part  of  that  area  that  is  covered  by the  cloud  is  suppressed.  For  example,  the  flames created  by  a  wall  of  fire  are  suppressed  within the  cloud,  creating  a  gap  in  the  wall  if  the  overlap is  large  enough.  Magic  on  Creatures  and  Objects:  Any  active magical  effect  on  a  creature  or  an  object  in  the cloud  is  suppressed  while  the  creature  or  object is  in  it.  Magic  Items:  The  properties  and  powers  of magic  items  are  suppressed  in  the  cloud.  For example,  a  +1  long  sword  in  the  cloud  functions as  a  nonmagical  long  sword.  A  magic  weapons  properties  and  powers  are suppressed  if  it  is  used  against  a  target  in  the cloud  or  wielded  by  an  attacker  in  the  cloud.  If  a magic  weapon  or  a  piece  of  magic  ammunition fully  leaves  the  cloud  (for  example,  if  you  fire  a magic  arrow  or  throw  a  magic  spear  at  a  target outside  the  cloud),  the  magic  of  the  item  ceases to  be  suppressed  as  soon  as  it  exits.  Magical  Travel:  Teleportation  fails  to  work  in the  cloud,  whether  the  cloud  is  the  destination  or the  departure  point  for  such  magical  travel.  A portal  to  another  world  or  plane  of  existence,  as well  as  an  opening  to  an  extradimensional  space, such  as  that  created  by  a  rope  trick  spell, temporarily  closes  while  in  the  cloud.  Summoned  Creatures:  A  creature  summoned by  magic  temporarily  winks  out  of  existence  in the  cloud.  Such  a  creature  instantly  reappears once  the  space  the  creature  occupied  is  no longer  within  the  cloud.  Dispel  Magic:  Spells  and  magical  effects  such  as dispel  magic  and  greater  dispel  magic  have  no effect  on  the  cloud.  Likewise,  the  clouds  created by  different  antimagic  fields  do  not  nullify  each other. " />

Your  astral  body  resembles  your  mortal  form in  almost  every  way,  replicating  your  game statistics  and  possessions.  The  principal difference  is  the  addition  of  a  silvery  cord  that extends  out  from  between  your  shoulder  blades and  trails  behind  you,  fading  to  invisibility  after 1  foot.  This  cord  is  your  tether  to  your  material body.  As  long  as  the  tether  remains  intact,  you can  find  your  way  home.

For  the  duration,  an  intense  tremor rips  through  the  ground  in  a  100-foot-radius circle  centered  on  that  point  and  shakes creatures  and  structures  in  contact  with  the ground  in  that  area.  The  ground  in  the  area  becomes  difficult terrain.  Each  creature  on  the  ground  that  is concentrating  on  a  spell  must  make  a Constitution  saving  throw.  On  a  failed  save,  the creatures  concentration  is  broken.  When  you  cast  this  spell  and  at  the  end  of  each turn  you  spend  concentrating  on  it,  each creature  on  the  ground  in  the  area  must  make  a Dexterity  saving  throw.  On  a  failed  save,  the creature  is  knocked  prone,  and  if  it  has  50  hit points  or  fewer,  it  cannot  take  actions  until  it leaves  the  area  or  the  spell  ends.  This  spell  has  additional  effects  depending  on the  terrain  in  the  area.  Open  Ground:  Fissures  open  throughout  the spells  area  at  the  start  of  your  next  turn  after you  cast  the  spell.  Each  Medium  or  smaller creature  on  the  ground  in  the  spells  area  must succeed  on  a  Dexterity  saving  throw  or  fall  1d10 x  10  feet  into  a  fissure,  taking  falling  damage  as normal.  The  DC  to  climb  out  is  the  same  as  the spell  save  DC.  Any  pools  of  liquid  in  the  area  drain  into  the fissures.  Falling  Rubble:  In  any  indoor  area,  rubble  falls from  the  ceiling.  Each  creature  in  the  affected area  must  make  a  Dexterity  saving  throw.  On  a failed  save,  the  creature  takes  5d6  bludgeoning damage,  is  knocked  prone,  and  becomes  buried in  the  rubble.  On  a  successful  save,  it  takes  half  as  much  damage  and  does  not  fall  prone  or become  buried.  A  creature  buried  in  rubble  cannot  move  and might  not  be  able  to  see  or  hear  beyond  the rubble.  For  each  full  minute  the  creature  spends buried,  it  takes  2d6  bludgeoning  damage.  A buried  creature  can  spend  one  minute  to  make  a Strength  check  to  try  to  dig  out  of  the  rubble.  The DM  sets  the  DC  based  on  the  material:  DC  15  is appropriate  for  a  typical  mixture  of  earth  and stone.  On  a  successful  check,  the  creature  digs itself  free.  Another  creature  can  spend  a  minute to  dig  out  a  creature  buried  in  rubble.  The  DM  might  decide  that  digging  out  from  the rubble  takes  more  than  a  minute,  depending  on the  amount  of  rubble  involved.  For  example,  a structure  that  has  entirely  collapsed  produces more  rubble  than  a  ceiling  that  has  simply dropped  debris.  Cliff:  If  the  spells  area  touches  or  includes  a vertical  surface,  such  as  a  cliff,  that  does  not  have a  ceiling,  the  vertical  surface  crumbles  away  and becomes  a  landslide.  The  landslide  pushes  out from  the  affected  surface  horizontally  as  far  as  it falls  vertically.  For  example,  if  the  affected  area is  100  feet  tall,  the  landslide  spreads  out  100  feet from  the  cliffs  base  in  any  direction  where  its path  is  unobstructed.  The  landslide  begins  at  the start  of  your  turn  after  you  cast  the  spell.  Each  creature  in  the  landslides  path  is  affected by  falling  rubble  (see  above).  If  a  creature successfully  saves  against  the  rubble,  the landslide  moves  the  creature  along  with  it  in  a straight  line  away  from  the  vertical  surface  to  a space  on  the  slides  leading  edge.  Structures:  The  tremor  deals  50  bludgeoning damage  to  any  structure  in  contact  with  the ground  in  the  area  when  you  cast  the  spell  and  at the  start  of  each  of  your  turns  until  the  spell  ends. If  a  structure  drops  to  0  hit  points,  it  collapses. " />

The suggested  course  of  action  can  continue  for  the entire  duration,  such  as  in  the  case  of  the  orc band  mentioned  above.  If  the  suggested  activity can  be  completed  in  a  shorter  time,  the  spell ends  when  the  subject  finishes  what  it  was  asked to  do.  You  can  instead  specify  conditions  that will  trigger  a  special  activity  during  the  duration. For  example,  you  might  suggest  that  a  group  of soldiers  give  all  their  money  to  the  first  beggar they  meet.  If  the  condition  is  not  met  before  the spell  duration  expires,  the  activity  is  not performed. " />

An  affected  target  is  so  convinced  of  the phantasms  reality  that  it  can  even  take  damage from  the  illusion.  A  phantasm  created  to  appear as  a  creature  can  attack  the  target.  Similarly,  a phantasm  created  to  appear  as  fire,  a  pool  of  acid, or  lava  can  burn  the  target.  Each  round  on  your turn,  you  can  cause  the  phantasm  to  deal  1d6 damage  to  the  target  if  it  is  in  the  phantasms area  or  within  5  feet  of  it.

If  the  teleportation  circle  is  too  small  to hold  all  the  creatures  you  transported,  they appear  in  the  closest  unoccupied  spaces  next  to the  circle.  You  can  use  this  spell  to  banish  an  unwilling creature  to  another  plane.  Choose  a  creature  you can  touch.  That  creature  must  make  a  Dexterity saving  throw.  On  a  failed  save,  you  touch  the creature,  which  must  then  make  a  Charisma saving  throw.

Very  familiar  is  a  place you  have  been  very  often  and  where  you  feel  at home.  Studied  carefully  is  a  location  you  know well,  because  you  have  been  there  often  or  you have  used  other  means  to  study  the  place.  Seen casually  is  someplace  you  have  seen  more  than once  but  with  which  you  are  not  very  familiar. Viewed  once  is  a  place  you  have  seen  once, possibly  using  magic.  Description  is  a  place whose  location  and  appearance  you  know through  someone  elses  description,  perhaps from  a  map.  False  destination  is  a  place  that  doesnt  exist. Perhaps  you  tried  to  scry  an  enemys  sanctum but  instead  viewed  an  illusion,  or  you  are attempting  to  teleport  to  a  familiar  location  that no  longer  exists.   Associated  object  means  that  you  possess  an object  taken  from  the  desired  destination  within the  last  six  months,  such  as  a  book  from  a wizards  library,  bed  linen  from  a  royal  suite,  a chunk  of  marble  from  a  lichs  secret  tomb,  or  the like.  On  Target:  You  and  your  group  appear  where you  want  to.  Off  Target:  You  and  your  group  appear  a random  distance  away  from  the  destination  in  a random  direction.  Distance  off  target  is  1d10   1d10%  of  the  distance  that  was  to  be  traveled. For  example,  if  you  tried  to  travel  120  miles, landed  off  target,  and  rolled  a  5  and  3  on  the  two d10s,  then  you  would  be  off  target  by  15%,  or  18 miles.  The  DM  determines  the  direction  off target  randomly  by  rolling  a  d8.  On  a  1,  north;  2, northeast;  3,  east;  4,  southeast;  5,  south;  6, southwest;  7,  west;  8,  northwest.  If  you  were teleporting  to  a  coastal  city  and  wound  up  18 miles  out  at  sea,  you  could  be  in  trouble.  Similar  Area:  You  wind  up  in  an  area  thats visually  or  thematically  similar  to  the  target  area. A  mage  heading  for  her  home  laboratory,  for example,  might  wind  up  in  another  mages laboratory  or  in  an  alchemical  supply  shop  that has  many  of  the  same  tools  and  implements  as  in her  laboratory.  Generally,  you  appear  in  the closest  similar  place,  but  since  the  spell  has  no range  limit,  you  could  conceivably  wind  up anywhere  on  the  plane.  Mishap:  You  and  anyone  else  teleporting  with you  are  assaulted  by  the  spells  magic.  You  each take  1d10  force  damage,  and  you  reroll  on  the table  to  see  where  you  wind  up.  For  these  rerolls, roll  1d20  +  80  instead  of  d100.  Each  time  this result  comes  up,  you  take  another  1d10  force damage  and  reroll. " />

The  webs fill  a  20-foot  radius  centered  on  that  point  for  the duration.  The  webs  are  difficult  terrain  and lightly  obscure  their  area.  If  the  webs  are  not  anchored  between  two solid  masses  (such  as  walls  or  trees)  or  layered across  a  floor,  wall,  or  ceiling,  the  conjured  web collapses  on  itself  and  the  spell  ends  at  the  start of  your  next  turn.  Webs  layered  over  a  flat surface  have  a  depth  of  5  feet.  Each  creature  that  starts  its  turn  in  the  webs or  that  enters  them  for  the  first  time  during  its turn  must  make  a  Dexterity  saving  throw.  On  a failed  save,  the  creature  is  restrained  as  long  as  it remains  in  the  webs  or  until  it  breaks  free.  A  creature  restrained  by  the  webs  can  use  its action  to  make  a  Strength  check  against  your spell  save  DC.  If  it  succeeds,  it  is  no  longer restrained.  The  webs  are  flammable.  Any  5-foot-cube  of webs  exposed  to  fire  burns  away  at  the  start  of your  next  turn.  The  fire  spreads  5  feet  at  the  end of  each  turn  until  the  web  burns  away.  Any creature  that  starts  its  turn  in  an  area  of  burning webs  takes  2d4  fire  damage. " />

While  in  a cloud  form,  a  creature  has  a  fly  speed  of  300  feet, and  has  resistance  against  damage  from nonmagical  weapons.  The  only  actions  a creature  can  take  in  this  form  are  to  hustle  or  to resume  its  normal  form.  Resuming  normal  form takes  1  minute.  Until  the  duration  expires,  a creature  can  revert  to  cloud  form;  this  also requires  1  minute.   If  a  creature  is  in  cloud  form  and  flying  when the  effect  ends,  it  descends  60  feet  per  round  for 1  minute  until  it  lands,  which  it  does  safely.

<spell cclass="Mage" name="Wish" level="9" kind="Conjuration" ritual="0" init="5" casttime="1 Action" duration="Instantaneous" range="0" conc="0" save="-" damage="-" dmgtype="-" halfdmg="0" number="1+" components="-" empower="-" shortdesc="Recreate another spell, or other desired effect" longdesc="Wish  is  the  mightiest  spell  a  mortal  creature  can cast.  By  simply  speaking  aloud,  you  can  alter  the very  foundations  of  reality  in  accord  with  your desires.  The  basic  use  of  this  spell  is  to  duplicate  any other  spell  of  8th  level  or  lower.  You  do  not  need to  meet  any  requirements.  The  spell  simply  takes effect.  Alternatively,  you  can  achieve  any  one  of  the following  effects.  Create  one  object  of  up  to  25,000  gp  in  value that  is  not  a  magic  item.  Create  one  common,  uncommon,  or  rare  magic item.  Allow  up  to  twenty  creatures  to  regain  all  hit points  and  end  all  effects  on  them  described  in the  greater  restoration  spell.  Grant  up  to  ten  creatures  immunity  to  a damage  type,  a  magical  effect,  or  some  other effect  for  8  hours.  For  instance,  you  could make  yourself  and  all  your  companions immune  to  a  lichs  life  drain  attack.  Undo  a  single  recent  event  by  forcing  a  reroll of  any  roll  made  within  the  last  round (including  your  last  turn).  Reality  reshapes itself  to  accommodate  the  new  result.  For example,  a  wish  spell  could  undo  an opponents  successful  save,  a  foes  successful critical  hit,  a  friends  failed  save,  and  so  on.  You must  accept  the  result  of  the  reroll,  even  if  it  is less  favorable  to  you  than  the  original  roll. You  might  be  able  to  achieve  something  beyond the  scope  of  the  above  examples.  To  do  so,  state your  wish  to  the  DM  as  precisely  as  possible. Your  DM  has  a  lot  of  latitude  in  ruling  what occurs  in  such  an  instance;  the  greater  the  wish, the  greater  the  likelihood  that  something  goes wrong.  Either  the  spell  simply  fails,  the  effect you  desire  is  only  partly  achieved,  or  you  suffer some  unforeseen  consequence  as  a  result  of  how the  wish  was  worded.  For  example,  wishing  that a  villain  were  dead  might  propel  you  forward  in time  to  a  period  when  that  villain  is  no  longer alive,  effectively  removing  you  from  the  game. Similarly,  wishing  for  a  legendary  magic  item  or artifact  might  instantly  transport  you  to  the presence  of  the  items  current  owner.  The  stress  of  casting  this  spell  to  produce  any effect  other  than  duplicating  another  spell weakens  you.  Until  you  complete  a  long  rest,  you lose  the  ability  to  cast  spells.  In  addition,  your Strength  drops  to  3,  if  it  is  not  3  or  lower  already, for  2d4  days.  For  each  of  those  days  that  you spend  resting  and  doing  nothing  more  than  light activity,  your  remaining  recovery  time  decreases by  2  days." />

Additionally, the  creature  must  make  a  Wisdom  saving  throw or  be  frightened  until  the  spell  ends.  As  an  action, the  creature  can  make  a  Wisdom  check  against your  spell  save  DC  to  steel  its  resolve  and  end this  spell.

On  a  failed  save,  a  creature  cannot  speak  a deliberate  lie  while  in  the  radius.  You  know whether  each  creature  succeeds  or  fails  on  its saving  throw.  An  affected  creature  is  aware  of  the  spell  and may  thus  avoid  answering  questions  to  which  it would  normally  respond  with  a  lie.
